# To-Do-List
A To-Do List is a simple task-management tool that helps users organize, track, and prioritize their daily activities. It allows users to add tasks, mark completed ones, and remove tasks they no longer need. By keeping responsibilities clearly listed in one place, a to-do list improves productivity and reduces stress.
